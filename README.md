# Python-Sixties

Parsing of fixed width text databases derived in the Seventies from the Sixtiesâ€™ spirit of the previous century.

## What is in it
Probably nothing interest for most visitors.

## To Do

* detect topics as hashes
* avoid intermediate data proofing (duplicated data)
* support with tests (to make data proofing irrelevant)
* align with published hierarchical structures
* enable clear transfer from specs to data classes (or whatever will be used in implementation)
* map parsers to spec aligned names
